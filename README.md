# multiplayer-base
base game for godot multiplayer

created by following tutorial created by Game Development Center on youtube

## What is in it?
This contains all the basic behavior needed to make a server authoritative game in Godot 3.
features
- User authentication
- supports using multiple game servers for different zones/worlds
- player positions/animation/stat sync across network
- player login credentials

## Purpose
This project was used to act as a teaching method for me. I will be using this as a template for the current game I am working on. (https://github.com/TheLowSeas/Undergrowth2)
For my project I will be removing the player verification before logging into the game as I don't see it as needed.
